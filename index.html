    <title>The Great Debate: Pizza vs. Burgers</title>

    <h2>Which is better: Pizza or Burgers?</h2>

    <section class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h2>Pro-pizza says...</h2>
        <p>There are many different reasons why I think Pizza is better than Burgers:<br>
        For starters, Pizza can be shared! A large pizza can feed up to 5 people! -OR- it could feed one lucky person for an entire 2 days! XD <br>
        The second reason to why I think Pizza is the more superior food group, is the endless amount of possible topping combinations! Whether you're a vegatarian or a meat lover- you can always tailor your Pizza to your exact liking! <br>

        <p>Alright. So pizza may look like the ultimate food to share because it is served in slices. But the complete package always includes the journey.<br> Picture this: summer picnic and you have the juicy burger patties on the grill. Nothing can get the gang together any better!<br> Pizza may have combinations, but the burger can out-do the possibilities any day: you can come up with a variety of burger combinations with sauces, meat and veggie ingredients and even choice of bun.</p>

          <p>Ok, Ok! I see your valid points you've made on why YOU think burgers are better! <br>
        Maybe my next point will change your mind!<br>
        The third and most important point as to why I think Pizza is better (drum roll please).. <br>
        Pizza is CHEAP and EVERYWHERE!<br>
        So next time you want a meal that includes all 4 food groups, doesn't break the bank, and pretty certainly saves lives- ORDER A PIZZA! (stick to Ma & Pa's neighbour resturants, because supporting local is a must :)</p>

        <p>Alright. I concede. Tonya has made some good points about pizza. Both burger and pizza are good food. Now, let's dig in!</p>
