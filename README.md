## History

The history of Pizza dates back to the Roman Empire. Baked bread with tomatoes can be considered the very start to the pizza revolution! Burgers can be dated back to the 13th century horseman, who ate minced meat between two slices of bread.

## Credits

Tonya Oliver will be dating why she believes Pizza is better than burgers. She was born and raised in London, Ontario. She really knows the value in capturing precious moments in life as she is an avid crafts maker of stone jewelry and the mother of a lovely daugther.

Jonathan Alquiza will be taking the burger's side in this debate. He hails from the Philippines in southeast Asia. He lives the moment and gets involved with creative opportunities that require the imagination and play.
